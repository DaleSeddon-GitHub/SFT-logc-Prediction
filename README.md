# SFT-log(c)-Prediction
Python code accompanying the academic paper 'Machine learning hybrid approach for the prediction of surface tension profiles of surfactants in aqueous solution' to predict the SFT-log(c) isotherm for surfactants in water at 20-30C, using the Szyszkowski equation.

Download all the files within this repository and run logC-SFT.ipynb to predict the SFT-log(c) isotherm. Excel files with the descriptors ordered as shown in the supplementary information will be needed for the prediction. An example file for each of the target variables is given in this repository.
